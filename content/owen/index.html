  <h1 class="headertext">Hey!</h1>
  <p class="headerbody">I am Owen, a 14-year-old with a passion and love for Technology. In my free time, I usually jump to try new tech hobbies, such as Linux, discovering for New Hardware, etc.</p>
  <p class="headerbody">I am also an advocate for right-to-repair, a protest against companies to let their products easily be repairable and to breath new life to old hardware. In the game side of my life, I play osu!, a free to play rhythm game where you click the circles. I have also dedicated time into playing osu! and have grinded my way to a reputable rank in it. And what really sets my future is being a Computer Science Major and develop programs for the people. </p>
